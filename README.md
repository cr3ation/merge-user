# Merge User
> Because name changes sucks.

Are you an Mac Admin or macOS user in an environment where an IdP is used to
authenticate login?

Have you just got married and your company updated your ID and are 
now unable to access your Documents, Keychain, FileVault and settings?

__Merge User.app__ lets you keep all your old files/settings together with your 
new updated name. Keeping your original User ID and adding you new User Name as an alias.
